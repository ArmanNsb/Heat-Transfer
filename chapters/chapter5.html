                    <p>This chapter is where we transition from classical, foundational theory to how modern engineering problems are actually solved in practice. This introductory section is less about formulas and more about mindset, which is arguably more important.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The Core Concept Breakdown</h3>
                    <p>This section is all about one central question: Why do we need complicated computer methods when we've just learned how to find exact, elegant analytical solutions?</p>
                    <p>The textbook's answer is simple: because the real world is messy. The perfect spheres, infinite cylinders, and flat walls we've been studying are the engineering equivalent of a physicist's "assume a spherical cow." They are fantastic for learning principles, but they rarely exist in a real plant.</p>
                    
                    <div class="insight">
                        <i><b>Physical Insight: The Car Analogy 🚗</b>
                        <br><b>Analytical Solution (Chapters 1-4):</b> This is like calculating the drag on a perfect sphere in a wind tunnel. You can use a beautiful, exact equation. The answer is precise and elegant. But... you haven't designed a car. You've solved a perfect, idealized problem.
                        <br><b>Numerical Solution (Chapter 5 and beyond):</b> This is like taking a highly detailed 3D CAD model of a real car—with mirrors, wheels, door handles, and a weird spoiler—and trying to find the drag on it. There is no single equation for this complex shape. So, what do we do? We use a computer to break the car's surface into a million tiny, simple shapes (a "mesh"). The computer then solves a very simple, approximate version of the physics on each tiny square and adds up all the results. The final answer isn't "exact," but it's an incredibly good approximation for the real-world object.</i>
                    </div>

                    <div class="rule-of-thumb">
                        <b>Design Implication:</b> An approximate solution for a realistic model is far more valuable than an exact solution for an oversimplified model. 📈
                    </div>

                    <h3>Why does this matter to you as an engineer? 🏭</h3>
                    <p>In your career, you will almost never solve a real-world heat transfer problem with an infinite series. You will use software that is built on the numerical methods introduced in this chapter, like FEA (Finite Element Analysis) or CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics). This chapter teaches you to be a responsible and intelligent user of these powerful tools.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>It Solves Real Problems:</b> Need to find the temperature distribution in a complex pump casing with cooling fins and bolt holes? Analytical methods fail completely. A numerical method is your only option.</li>
                        <li><b>It Allows for "What-Ifs":</b> Your boss asks, "What if we make the cooling fins 2 cm longer? And what if we change the material from cast iron to aluminum?" With a numerical model, you just change a few parameters and click "run." Doing this analytically would be impossible.</li>
                        <li><b>It Builds Critical Thinking:</b> Knowing how the computer gets its answer stops you from treating it like a magic black box. You'll understand that the quality of your input (the "mesh," the boundary conditions) directly affects the quality of the output. It empowers you to question a result that looks wrong.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Key Takeaways: Analytical vs. Numerical Solutions</h3>
                    <h4>1. Analytical Solutions (The "Classical" Way)</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>✅ Pros:</b> Exact for the given model, provides an equation that builds physical intuition.</li>
                        <li><b>❌ Cons:</b> Limited to simple geometries, limited to simple physics (e.g., constant properties), mathematically difficult.</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>Now we get into the nuts and bolts of how numerical methods actually work. This section introduces the core mathematical trick that allows a computer—which can only do basic arithmetic—to solve calculus problems. It's a foundational concept.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The Core Concept Breakdown</h3>
                    <p>How do we turn a complex differential equation into simple algebra that a computer can handle? The answer is the <b>Finite Difference Method</b>.</p>
                    <p>The core idea is brilliantly simple: Any smooth curve, if you zoom in far enough, looks like a straight line. Calculus (derivatives, integrals) is the language of smooth, continuous curves. Algebra is the language of discrete points and straight lines. The Finite Difference method is our translator.</p>

                        <i><b>Physical Insight: Building a Curve with Lego Bricks 🧱</b>
                        <br>Imagine you have to build a large, smooth archway (the true temperature profile, \KATEX_INLINE_OPEN T(x) \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE) using only small, straight Lego bricks (our finite difference approximations).
                        <br><b>1. Discretization:</b> You decide on your brick size (\KATEX_INLINE_OPEN \Delta x \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE) and lay out connection points, called <b>nodes</b>.
                        <br><b>2. Approximation:</b> You connect the nodes with your straight bricks. The slope of each brick (\KATEX_INLINE_OPEN \Delta T / \Delta x \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE) is an approximation of the true slope of the curve (\KATEX_INLINE_OPEN dT/dx \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE) at that point.
                        <br><b>3. The Result:</b> You get a Lego version of the arch. If you use tiny bricks (small \KATEX_INLINE_OPEN \Delta x \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE), your Lego arch will be a very good approximation of the real one.</i>

                    <p>This fundamental translation powers most thermal simulation software.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>It Turns Calculus into Algebra:</b> The heat equation \KATEX_INLINE_OPEN d^2T/dx^2 + \dot{e}/k = 0 \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE is a differential equation. By substituting the finite difference approximation, it becomes \KATEX_INLINE_OPEN (T_{m-1} - 2T_m + T_{m+1})/\Delta x^2 + \dot{e}_m/k = 0 \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE. This is just an algebraic equation!</li>
                        <li><b>It Creates a System of Equations:</b> You apply this simple algebraic equation to every single internal "node" in your object. If you have 100 nodes, you get a system of 100 simple algebraic equations with 100 unknown temperatures.</li>
                        <li><b>Computers are Kings at This:</b> Solving a huge system of linear algebraic equations is what computers were born to do. They can solve for thousands, or even millions, of unknown nodal temperatures incredibly fast using matrix algebra.</li>

                    <h3>Key Takeaways & Formulas</h3>
                    <h4>1. The Concept of Discretization</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Domain:</b> The continuous physical object (e.g., a wall of thickness \KATEX_INLINE_OPEN L \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE).</li>
                        <li><b>Nodes:</b> A finite number of specific points \KATEX_INLINE_OPEN m = 0, 1, 2, ... M \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE within the domain.</li>

                    <h4>2. The Finite Difference Approximations</h4>
                    <p>First Derivative (Slope):</p>
                    ```math
                    \frac{dT}{dx} \approx \frac{T_{m+1} - T_{m-1}}{2\Delta x} \quad \text{(Central difference - most accurate)}
                    ```
                    <p>Second Derivative (Curvature) - <b>THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE:</b></p>
                    ```math
                    \frac{d^2T}{dx^2} \bigg|_m \approx \frac{T_{m+1} - 2T_m + T_{m-1}}{\Delta x^2}
                    ```

                    <h4>3. The Finite Difference Equation (for a 1D interior node)</h4>
                    <p>Start with the heat equation: \KATEX_INLINE_OPEN d^2T/dx^2 + \dot{e}/k = 0 \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE</p>
                    <p>Substitute the approximation for the second derivative:</p>
                    ```math
                    \frac{T_{m-1} - 2T_m + T_{m+1}}{\Delta x^2} + \frac{\dot{e}_m}{k} = 0
                    ```

                    <h4>4. The Simplest Case: 1D Steady-State, No Heat Generation</h4>
                    <p>If \KATEX_INLINE_OPEN \dot{e}=0 \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE, the equation simplifies to: \KATEX_INLINE_OPEN T_{m-1} - 2T_m + T_{m+1} = 0 \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE</p>
                    <p>Rearranging gives:</p>
                    ```math
                    T_m = \frac{T_{m-1} + T_{m+1}}{2}
                    ```

                        <br>Imagine your slab of steel is a long hallway of offices. Each office is a <b>control volume</b>, and the person at the desk is the <b>node</b> (\KATEX_INLINE_OPEN T_m \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE). An accountant in each office enforces one rule for steady-state: <b>The net flow of money (heat) into the office must be zero.</b>
                        <br>The accountant's ledger at Node m:
                        <br>+ Money from left (\KATEX_INLINE_OPEN Q_{left} \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE)

                        <li><b>It's more intuitive:</b> Thinking in terms of energy flowing in and out of a small volume is often much easier and more physical than thinking about second derivatives.</li>

                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>We've mastered steady-state, where things are settled and unchanging. Now we're moving on to the more dynamic world of transient problems, where temperatures change over time. This section introduces the core concepts and the two main philosophical approaches to solving these problems numerically.</p>

                    <h3>The Core Concept Breakdown</h3>
                    <p>In steady-state problems, we find the final, unchanging temperature at each node. In transient problems, we find the temperature at every node at every single step in time. We're not just finding the final destination; we're plotting the entire journey.</p>
                    <p>To do this, we must discretize not only space (using \KATEX_INLINE_OPEN \Delta x \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE) but also time (using a time step, \KATEX_INLINE_OPEN \Delta t \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE). We are essentially taking a series of snapshots of the temperature profile as it evolves.</p>
                    
                    <div class="insight">
                        <i><b>Physical Insight: The Bucket Brigade 💧</b>
                        <br>Imagine a line of people (nodes) passing buckets of water (heat). The initial state is that everyone is holding a full bucket (\KATEX_INLINE_OPEN T_m^0 = T_{initial} \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE).
                        <br><b>Time Step (\KATEX_INLINE_OPEN \Delta t \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE):</b> The fire chief blows a whistle. Everyone has a set amount of time (\KATEX_INLINE_OPEN \Delta t \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE) to pass some water.
                        <br><b>The New Energy Balance:</b> The rule is no longer Energy In = 0. For a transient problem, the rule is: <b>(Energy In) - (Energy Out) = Change in Storage</b>. The "Change in Storage" term is \KATEX_INLINE_OPEN \rho V c_p (T_{new} - T_{old}) \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE. This is the crucial new piece.
                        </i>
                    </div>

                    <h3>The Explicit vs. Implicit Dilemma</h3>
                    <p>When the whistle blows, how do you decide how much water to pass? Do you base your decision on:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>How full your neighbors' buckets were <b>before</b> the whistle blew?</li>
                        <li>How full their buckets <b>will be after</b> this round of passing is over?</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>This is the fundamental difference between the two methods:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Explicit Method (Easy but potentially unstable):</b> "I will decide based on how full my neighbors' buckets were at the last whistle blow (time i)." This is easy! I know all the old values. I can directly calculate my own new water level (\KATEX_INLINE_OPEN T_m^{i+1} \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE) without having to ask anyone else.</li>
                        <li><b>Implicit Method (Difficult but unconditionally stable):</b> "I will decide based on the unknown water levels my neighbors will have at the next whistle blow (time i+1)." This is hard! My new water level depends on my neighbor's new water level, which depends on their neighbor's, and so on. We have to create a massive system of simultaneous equations involving all the unknown "new" temperatures and solve them all at once for every single time step.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Why does this matter to you as an engineer? ⏱️</h3>
                    <p>This is a fundamental choice you (or the software you're using) must make when solving any transient problem.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The <b>Explicit method</b> is simple and computationally "cheap" per time step. However, if your time step \KATEX_INLINE_OPEN \Delta t \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE is too large, the calculations can "blow up" with wild oscillations. It has a strict <b>stability criterion</b>.</li>
                        <li>The <b>Implicit method</b> is more work per time step. However, it is <b>unconditionally stable</b>. You can take very large time steps without the solution blowing up. It will always converge to a physically reasonable answer.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Key Takeaways & Formulas</h3>
                    <h4>1. Discretization in Time</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Time Step (\KATEX_INLINE_OPEN \Delta t \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE):</b> The small interval of time between calculations.</li>
                        <li><b>Time Index (i):</b> The counter for time steps. \KATEX_INLINE_OPEN t = i \cdot \Delta t \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE.</li>
                        <li><b>Nodal Temperature Notation:</b> \KATEX_INLINE_OPEN T_m^i \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE is the temperature at node \KATEX_INLINE_OPEN m \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE at time step \KATEX_INLINE_OPEN i \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE. \KATEX_INLINE_OPEN T_m^{i+1} \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE is the unknown temperature at the next time step.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>2. The General Transient Energy Balance</h4>
                    <p>In Words: (Sum of heat transfer IN) + (Heat generation) = (Rate of change of internal energy)</p>
                    ```math
                    \sum Q_{in} + E_{gen} = \rho V c_p \frac{T_m^{i+1} - T_m^i}{\Delta t}
                    ```

                    <h4>3. The Two Formulations</h4>
                    <p>The key difference is at which time step (i or i+1) you evaluate the heat transfer terms (\KATEX_INLINE_OPEN \sum Q_{in} + E_{gen} \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE).</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Explicit Method:</b> Evaluate heat transfer using the <b>old, known</b> temperatures from time step i. You can directly solve for the single unknown, \KATEX_INLINE_OPEN T_m^{i+1} \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE.</li>
                        <li><b>Implicit Method:</b> Evaluate heat transfer using the <b>new, unknown</b> temperatures from time step i+1. The equation for \KATEX_INLINE_OPEN T_m^{i+1} \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE contains the unknown temperatures of its neighbors, requiring a simultaneous solution.</li>

We're just applying it with a bit more bookkeeping.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The Core Concept Breakdown</h3>
                    <p>So far, we've been analyzing heat flow along a single line. But what about a flat plate where heat is flowing from inside to outside, but also from the hot center towards the cooler edges? For this, we need a 2D model. We're using the exact same "Nodal Accountant" method, but moving from a hallway to a full office floor plan laid out in a grid.</p>

                        <br><b>1D Model:</b> A single hallway of offices. Each accountant talked to neighbors on the left and right.
                        <br><b>2D Model:</b> A grid of cubicles. An accountant for an interior cubicle (Node m,n) now has four neighbors to worry about: Left (m-1, n), Right (m+1, n), Top (m, n+1), and Bottom (m, n-1).
                        <br>The fundamental rule remains the same for steady-state: <b>The sum of all energy flows in and out must be zero.</b>
                        <br>The accountant's ledger: \KATEX_INLINE_OPEN Q_{left} + Q_{right} + Q_{top} + Q_{bottom} + E_{gen} = 0 \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE.

                    <div class="rule-of-thumb">
                        <b>Engineer's Rule of Thumb:</b> For the simplest case (a square grid with \KATEX_INLINE_OPEN \Delta x = \Delta y \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE and no internal heat generation \KATEX_INLINE_OPEN \dot{e} = 0 \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE), the math simplifies perfectly. The temperature of any interior node is the simple arithmetic average of its four neighbors' temperatures. This is a powerful rule of thumb for quickly checking if a 2D simulation result "looks right."

                    <h3>Why does this matter to you as an engineer? 📈</h3>
                    <p>This is the gateway to solving the vast majority of real-world steady-state problems.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>It Models Reality:</b> Almost no industrial component is truly 1D. A pipe flange loses heat both radially and axially. 2D analysis captures these crucial effects.</li>
                        <li><b>Identifies Hot/Cold Spots:</b> This method allows you to find the temperature at a corner of a furnace, which will be cooler than the center of a wall because heat can escape in two directions. This is critical for predicting thermal stress points.</li>
                        <li><b>Foundation for 3D:</b> Once you understand the bookkeeping for 2D (four neighbors), extending it to 3D (six neighbors: left, right, top, bottom, front, back) is conceptually straightforward.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Key Takeaways & Formulas</h3>
                    <h4>1. The Nodal Network (The Grid)</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Nodes are identified by two indices: \KATEX_INLINE_OPEN T_{m,n} \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE, where \KATEX_INLINE_OPEN m \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE is the position in the x-direction and \KATEX_INLINE_OPEN n \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE is the position in the y-direction.</li>
                        <li>Nodal spacing can be different (\KATEX_INLINE_OPEN \Delta x, \Delta y \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE) but is often the same for simplicity (\KATEX_INLINE_OPEN \Delta x = \Delta y = l \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE), which is called a square mesh.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>2. The General Equation for an Interior Node (m,n)</h4>
                    <p>This comes directly from the energy balance. It is the finite difference form of the 2D heat equation.</p>
                    ```math
                    \frac{T_{m-1,n} - 2T_{m,n} + T_{m+1,n}}{\Delta x^2} + \frac{T_{m,n-1} - 2T_{m,n} + T_{m,n+1}}{\Delta y^2} + \frac{\dot{e}_{m,n}}{k} = 0
                    ```

                    <h4>3. The Simplified Equation (Square Mesh, \KATEX_INLINE_OPEN \Delta x = \Delta y = l \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE)</h4>
                    <p>This is the more common and easier-to-remember form.</p>
                    ```math
                    T_{m-1,n} + T_{m+1,n} + T_{m,n+1} + T_{m,n-1} - 4T_{m,n} + \frac{\dot{e}_{m,n} l^2}{k} = 0
                    ```
                    <p>Or, in words: \KATEX_INLINE_OPEN T_{left} + T_{right} + T_{top} + T_{bottom} - 4T_{node} + \text{(Generation Term)} = 0 \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE</p>

                    <h4>4. The "Golden Rule" for the Simplest Case</h4>
                    <p>Conditions: Steady-State, Square Mesh, and No Heat Generation.</p>
                    ```math
                    T_{m,n} = \frac{T_{m-1,n} + T_{m+1,n} + T_{m,n+1} + T_{m,n-1}}{4}
                    ```

                    <h4>5. Boundary Nodes</h4>
                    <p>The principle is the same: perform an energy balance on the control volume. The key difference is the size and shape of the control volume changes. A node on a flat edge has a half-size control volume. A node at an external corner has a quarter-size control volume.</p>

                    <p>It depends on the mesh:</p>

                        <li><b>Coarse Mesh (Large Blocks):</b> If you build your "circle" with huge blocks, it's going to be a terrible, blocky approximation and your results will be poor.</li>
                        <li><b>Fine Mesh (Small Blocks):</b> If you build your "circle" with tiny blocks, the stair-steps will be so small that your model will look almost perfectly smooth. The approximation is excellent, and your results will be very accurate.</li>

                        <br><b>Cost:</b> A finer mesh means vastly more nodes. More nodes mean more equations, which requires more computer memory (RAM) and significantly more processing time (CPU hours) to solve.
                        <br>As an engineer, you are constantly making this choice. Is a quick, coarse simulation good enough for a preliminary check? Or do you need to spend 12 hours running a high-fidelity simulation for final validation?

                    <h3>Key Takeaways & Formulas</h3>
                    <p>This is a conceptual section, so there are no new formulas. The focus is on the principle and its implications.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>The Problem:</b> Real-world objects often have curved or slanted boundaries that do not align with a simple rectangular (Cartesian) grid.</li>
                        <li><b>The Basic Solution:</b> The smooth, irregular boundary is approximated by a series of rectangular control volumes from the grid. This introduces a geometric discretization error.</li>
                        <li><b>The Accuracy vs. Cost Trade-Off:</b> To reduce the geometric error, you must use a finer mesh (smaller \KATEX_INLINE_OPEN \Delta x \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE and \KATEX_INLINE_OPEN \Delta y \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE), especially near the complex boundary. This is called mesh refinement. A finer mesh rapidly increases computational cost.</li>
                        <li><b>Advanced Methods:</b> Commercial software uses more advanced techniques like unstructured meshes (triangles/tetrahedrons) or body-fitted coordinates to handle complex shapes with higher accuracy.</li>

                        <br><b>The Implicit Method</b> is like a "circular reference" in Excel. To calculate a cell in the new row (\KATEX_INLINE_OPEN T_m^{i+1} \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE), the formula refers to other <b>unknown</b> cells in the <b>same new row</b>. You can't solve one cell at a time; you have to solve a large system of equations for the entire row simultaneously. The future is implicitly defined by its relationship with itself.

                    <p>This is the overall solution process. It's a simple, repetitive loop:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Start:</b> You know all temperatures at t=0 (row 0).</li>
                        <li><b>Calculate Step 1:</b> Use your chosen method to calculate all temperatures at t = \KATEX_INLINE_OPEN \Delta t \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE (fill in row 1).</li>
                        <li><b>Update:</b> The temperatures in row 1 are now your "old" temperatures.</li>
                        <li><b>Repeat:</b> Continue this process, "marching" forward in time, until you reach your desired final time.</li>

                    ```math

                    ```

                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>This is a crucial "user-beware" section for the explicit method. While the method is simple, it comes with a strict set of rules. The stability criterion is the rulebook that keeps the solution physically realistic and numerically stable.</p>

                    <h3>The Core Concept Breakdown</h3>
                    <p>This section is all about the Achilles' heel of the explicit method: instability. If you break the rules (take too large a time step), your solution will descend into chaos.</p>

                        <i><b>Physical Insight: Steering a Go-Kart 🏎️</b>
                        <br>Imagine your go-kart is the temperature of a node, and the track is the correct temperature path. \KATEX_INLINE_OPEN \Delta t \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE is how often you can look up and steer.
                        <br><b>Stable Condition (Small \KATEX_INLINE_OPEN \Delta t \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE):</b> You look up and make small steering corrections every tenth of a second. You stay smoothly on the track.
                        <br><b>Unstable Condition (Large \KATEX_INLINE_OPEN \Delta t \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE):</b> You close your eyes for 5 seconds between adjustments. You drift left, so you yank the wheel hard right. Now you've overshot and are heading for the right wall. You yank it hard left. Soon, you're spinning out of control. This is numerical instability.

                    </div>

                    <h3>The Physical Reason for Instability</h3>
                    <p>The new temperature \KATEX_INLINE_OPEN T_m^{i+1} \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE must be a weighted average of its neighbors' old temperatures. In the explicit formula, the coefficient on its own old temperature, \KATEX_INLINE_OPEN (1-2\tau) \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE, can become negative if \KATEX_INLINE_OPEN \Delta t \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE is too large. This would mean a hot node surrounded by cool neighbors would become even colder than them, which violates the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The stability criterion prevents this by ensuring this coefficient remains non-negative.</p>

                    <div class="rule-of-thumb">
                        <b>Design Implication: ⚠️</b> The stability criterion links your time step to your mesh size (\KATEX_INLINE_OPEN \Delta t \le C \cdot \Delta x^2 \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE). This means if you want to double the spatial resolution (make \KATEX_INLINE_OPEN \Delta x \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE half as big), you must make your time step <b>four times smaller</b>. Your total simulation time will increase dramatically. This is why the unconditionally stable implicit method is often preferred for complex problems.

                    <p>The Rule: The coefficient of the central node's own past temperature, \KATEX_INLINE_OPEN T_m^i \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE, in the explicit equation for \KATEX_INLINE_OPEN T_m^{i+1} \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE must be greater than or equal to zero.</p>

                            <br>The coefficient is \KATEX_INLINE_OPEN (1 - 2\tau) \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE. The criterion \KATEX_INLINE_OPEN 1 - 2\tau \ge 0 \KATEX_INLINE_CLOSE leads to:
